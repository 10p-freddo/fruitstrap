fruitstrap
==========
Install and debug iPhone apps without using Xcode. Designed to work on unjailbroken devices.

## Requirements

* Mac OS X. Tested on Snow Leopard only.
* You need to have a valid iPhone development certificate installed.
* Xcode must be installed, along with the SDK for your iOS version.

## Usage

* `fruitstrap [-q/--quiet] [-t/--timeout timeout(seconds)] [-v/--verbose] <command> [<args>]`

Commands available:
   install    [-i/--id device_id] -b/--bundle bundle.app [-a/--args arguments] 
    * Install the specified app with optional arguments to the specified device, or all attached devices if none are specified. 

   uninstall  [-i/--id device_id] -b/--bundle bundle.app 
    * Removed the specified bundle identifier (eg com.foo.MyApp) from the specified device, or all attached devices if none are specified. 

   list-devices  
    * List all attached devices. 


## Demo

* The included demo.app represents the minimum required to get code running on iOS.
* `make install` will install demo.app to the device.
* `make debug` will install demo.app and launch a GDB session.

## Notes

* With some modifications, it may be possible to use this without Xcode installed; however, you would need a copy of the relevant DeveloperDiskImage.dmg (included with Xcode). GDB would also run slower as symbols would be downloaded from the device on-the-fly.
